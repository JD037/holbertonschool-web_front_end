## Introduction

This project comprises a series of challenging tasks that aim to deepen the understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts. Each task is designed to reinforce learning and application of these concepts in various scenarios, ranging from simple function calls to complex closures and asynchronous programming.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding and application of lexical scoping in JavaScript
- Mastery of closure and its uses
- Insight into JavaScript's call stack and execution context
- Proficiency in binding context to functions
- Effective use of callbacks in asynchronous operations

## Installation

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/JD037/holbertonschool-web_front_end]

2. Navigate to the repository:

    ```bash
   cd [holbertonschool-web_front_end/Javascript_advanced]

## Tasks

1. **Lexical Scoping and Welcome Message**
   - Implement a function with nested scope.
2. **Closure Scope Chain**
   - Demonstrate closure with nested functions.
3. **Closure**
   - Create a closure for displaying welcome messages.
4. **Closure and Loops**
   - Utilize closure within a loop to create a classroom setting.
5. **Complex Closure**
   - Implement complex closures with arithmetic operations.
6. **Changing DOM with Closure**
   - Use closures to modify DOM elements.
7. **Private Methods with Closure**
   - Simulate private methods using closure in a module pattern.
8. **Stack Order and `setTimeout`**
   - Understand event loop and stack order with `setTimeout`.
9. **Stack Order in Functions**
   - Process orders and payments using function calls.
10. **Prime Numbers & Timing Execution**
    - Count prime numbers and measure execution time.
11. **Execution Stack & Timing Execution**
    - Execute the function `countPrimeNumbers` multiple times and measure performance.
12. **Changing Stack Order using `setTimeout`**
    - Manipulate stack order using `setTimeout` for optimized calculations.
13. **Binding**
    - Practice binding context to functions.
14. **Binding + Closure**
    - Combine binding with closure to maintain context in callbacks.
15. **Simple Callback**
    - Implement a simple callback pattern with data retrieval from an API.

## Testing

To test the functionalities, open your web inspector in the "Console" tab, copy and paste your code for each task, and verify the output as per the task's requirements. Ensure you test each task independently to avoid scope and closure-related conflicts.
